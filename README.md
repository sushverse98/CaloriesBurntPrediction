# CaloriesBurntPrediction
Calories burnt prediction using regression models in Python (ML-based fitness tracker).

# 🔥 Calories Burnt Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project predicts the number of calories burnt during physical activity using **Machine Learning regression models**. It takes inputs such as age, gender, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature to estimate calories burnt.  

The project is designed for **fitness tracking and health insights**, making it useful for individuals who want to monitor their workouts and optimize their fitness goals.

## 📊 Example Workflow
1. Preprocess dataset and split into training/testing sets  
2. Train regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)  
3. Evaluate performance using MAE, MSE, and R² Score  
4. Deploy model with Flask and connect to frontend  
5. Enter details in the web app to get calories burnt prediction

## 🌟 Future Improvements
- Add more features (e.g., activity type, intensity level)  
- Improve accuracy with advanced models (XGBoost, Neural Networks)  
- Deploy on **Streamlit, Heroku, or AWS** for public use
